# Application state

The application is currently still in a pre alpha version, it doesn't even have proper tagging for releases. 

There are some issues that need to be worked out before the app is released in the alpha version:
 - Wasm crypto functions are fast, but not as I wish they were
 - Files cannot be shared
 - No public links can be made with files
 - Settings for the users account are non-existent
 - Overall database design is still in the early stages and might change without a migration (still dropping when upgrading)
 - Frontend application has lost testing ability once the app switched to credentials mode of authentication (Jest cannot deal with http only cookies)
 - Currently, its using AES-AEAD encryption for files, that might change and would be a breaking change
 - Files are stored on disk in chunks, that is currently working and it won't change most likely, but.. It might be necessary for performance
 - ...I don't feel like it being ready yet.

# Installing via docker

The application itself can handle incoming traffic, but for best results, use a reverse proxy, something like [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/).

```shell
docker run --name hoodik -it -d \
-e DATA_DIR='/data' \
-e APP_URL='https://my-app.local' \
-e SSL_CERT_FILE='/data/my-cert-file.crt.pem' \
-e SSL_KEY_FILE='/data/my-key-file.key.pem' \
-e MAILER_TYPE='smtp' \
-e SMTP_ADDRESS='smtp.gmail.com' \
-e SMTP_USERNAME='email@gmail.com' \
-e SMTP_PASSWORD='google-account-app-password' \
-e SMTP_PORT='465' \
-e SMTP_DEFAULT_FROM='Hoodik Drive <email@gmail.com>' \
--volume "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
-p 4554:5443 \
htunlogic/hoodik:latest
```

# Database

The application supports either `Sqlite` or `Postgres` databases, `Sqlite`Â is enabled by default and it creates a database file in your `DATA_DIR` so it works out of the box. But if you want, you can also use outside `Postgres` database, in that case, you will need to provide the `DATABASE_URL` for the `Postgres` connection.
